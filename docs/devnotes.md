# Dev Notes

**16 Sept 23**

I have uvicorn installed and it runs on windows!! The command to run it is
```powershell
PS uvicorn start:app --reload
```
The site is up at http://localhost:8000/ and the docs are at http://localhost:8000/docs

*NOTE: An alternative format for the docs is http://localhost:8000/redoc*

## Devcontainer
The app also has a .devcontainer configured with it, works well starts up smoothly and runs
